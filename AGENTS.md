## Product rule

The core rule is:

`currently actionable weekday-NPC interaction -> NPC weekday -> marker`

The accepted GK 1.407 model has three evidence classes:

1. **Task-owned selectable interaction:** a current Visible task has an authored route through the weekday NPC, and every supported phrase/resource/navigation gate required for that route is currently satisfied.
2. **Dialogue-lifecycle interaction:** a reachable authored branch persistently consumes the selected answer itself or the nearest selectable ancestor on that same root-to-answer path. The nearest persistent lifecycle owner represents one visit/reminder interaction. Exact self-consumption wins over ancestor consumption; task-owned owners and same-visit descendants are deduplicated.
3. **Verified mandatory event stage:** no selectable answer represents the interaction. This remains limited to the exact runtime-proven event-only stages `npc_inquisitor/inquisitor_talk` and `npc_cultist/snake_back`.

Do not mark a weekday merely because an NPC has an unfinished quest. If the relevant step still requires crafting, finding, collecting, exploring, raising quality/relation, or another non-NPC prerequisite, it does not create a reminder yet.

Do not treat arbitrary visible menu options as reminders. Repeatable utility/navigation entries such as Trade, Leave, Back, or ordinary non-consuming submenu headers are excluded structurally. Do not implement this through translated/display-text matching.

Unknown, reversible, ambiguous, or unsupported structures fail closed. False positives remain more harmful than an unsupported false negative.

## Accepted runtime architecture

Accepted production **1.1.9** uses one persistent schema-6 interaction manifest plus cheap live bindings:

- `WeekdayInteractionRuleCache` derives owner-local and cross-owner task rules plus persisted dialogue-topic rules;
- direct `Flow_Answer` gates retain the established game-owned SmartRes evaluation;
- relay-backed `MultipleAnswerData` is now structurally supported through the verified chain `RelayValueOutput<MultipleAnswerData> -> RelayValueInput<MultipleAnswerData> -> Flow_MultipleAnswer -> Flow_AnswersArray -> child Flow_Answer`;
- compound children use the game's verified native **AND** semantics: every child lock and price requirement must be sufficient;
- production does not hard-code Souls quest IDs, weekday NPC IDs, or item IDs for that compound family;
- `NavigationReachabilityCache` derives root-to-answer paths, ordered selectable ancestors, and compact phrase/AnswerData predicates;
- `UnifiedDialogueLifecycleCompiler` is bootstrap-only and resolves exact-self plus nearest persistent lifecycle owners on concrete authored paths;
- lifecycle precedence remains self first, otherwise nearest consumed selectable ancestor; task-owned owners and same-visit descendants are suppressed from the generic dialogue layer;
- the complete six-NPC lifecycle census remains six unique ancestor-owner candidates: four admitted independent owners and two task-owned suppressions, with zero reversible owners admitted;
- `PersistentRuleManifest` schema 6 persists task rules, compound requirements, dialogue-lifecycle topics, navigation predicates, and lifecycle integrity counts to `BepInEx/cache/DayWheelQuestMarkers/rules-1.407.bin`;
- schema-5 files are incompatible by design and rebuild once behind loading; later loads deserialize schema 6;
- the exact six weekday-NPC graphs are parsed only during loading/bootstrap when schema 6 is missing or incompatible;
- normal gameplay never reparses FlowCanvas graphs;
- owner-local rules retain the verified authoritative `WorldZone.GetTotalQuality()` fallback for unambiguous authored quality mirrors;
- generic resource/relation/compound gates continue to delegate sufficiency to game-owned SmartRes/`Player.IsEnough` behavior;
- `VerifiedCompletionReminderRules` remains only a narrow supplement for verified task-completion topologies not represented by the generic task compiler; the two mandatory event-only stages remain exact mappings;
- there is no broad `Visible task`, arbitrary `CustomEvent`, translated-text, or universal external-provenance classifier;
- native marker sprites remain game-owned and cached through bounded lookup;
- known-NPC changes use cheap rebinding; steady one-second evaluation and approximately 30-second structural validation remain allocation-light.

Accepted schema-6 integrity/runtime counts:

- owner: **81 supported / 0 unsupported**;
- cross-owner: **8 tasks / 6 supported / 0 unsupported**;
- dialogue-lifecycle: **65 topics / 65 supported / 0 unsupported**;
- non-`@` universe: **77 unique / 19 exact-self / 6 admitted / 9 task/completion exclusions**;
- ancestor lifecycle owners: **6 candidates / 2 task-owned exclusions / 4 admitted / 4 supported / 0 unsupported**;
- navigation: **210 answers / 270 paths / 151 predicates / 0 unsupported**;
- verified relay-backed `MultipleAnswerData`: **7 menu uses across 4 weekday NPCs**.

Accepted 1.1.9 runtime evidence:

- schema-5 -> schema-6 bootstrap completed behind loading in **923.35 ms**;
- a subsequent process deserialized the persisted schema-6 manifest in **10.62 ms** with `FlowCanvas graph parse skipped`;
- the preserved Better Save Soul Snake state showed the expected **3 markers** including the new Envy/Snake reminder;
- selecting `@souls_s_s33_ask` completed `npc_cultist/dlc_souls_s29_3`, removed that authored answer, and the wheel transitioned **3 -> 2** while the two unrelated markers remained;
- no Day Wheel Quest Markers warning/error was observed in the accepted test.

The rejected universal provenance parser remains rejected. Production derives only verified local interaction/task/navigation semantics from the six weekday-NPC graphs and does not walk arbitrary external dependency chains.

## Marker sprite contract

Production uses the marker Sprite objects owned by the installed game at runtime. Do not embed or commit copied pixel payloads from Graveyard Keeper.

Verified sprite identifiers:

- `icon_quest_mark_small`
- `dlc_quest_mrk`
- `quest_marker_violet`
- `Icon_quest_mark_small_blue`

Resolve/cache these with bounded loaded-Sprite lookup. Normal lookup belongs in the verified loading/prewarm path; at most one runtime fallback lookup is allowed for a requested style that was not resident earlier. Game-owned Sprite objects must never be destroyed by the mod.

Do not introduce repeated broad `Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll` work into normal gameplay. Do not substitute custom art without explicit user approval.

## Performance

Steady-state runtime should be effectively negligible relative to the game:

- per frame: timer comparison only until the one-second tick is due;
- no continuous broad resource/hierarchy scans;
- no background worker;
- no save mutation;
- no FlowCanvas/navigation graph traversal during gameplay;
- reuse marker GameObjects and cached references;
- known-NPC count/fingerprint checks remain allocation-light;
- use the existing slow structural-staleness cadence rather than broad recurring validation.

Do not optimize speculative problems. The evidence-driven lineage is:

- 1.0.25 exposed a 302.22 ms first-NPC runtime rebuild;
- 1.0.26 moved graph work behind loading and persisted it;
- 1.0.28 removed recurring allocation pressure associated with the old roughly 30-second rhythmic hitch;
- 1.0.30 added persisted navigation reachability;
- 1.0.35 generalized non-`@` exact-self interactions;
- 1.1.3 unified exact-self persistence and fixed same-visit duplication;
- 1.1.6 generalized dialogue ownership to nearest persistent lifecycle owner;
- **1.1.9 closes the relay-backed `MultipleAnswerData` family without adding gameplay graph work**.

The one-time schema-6 bootstrap remains about one second on the tested developed save. Cached schema-6 reads are low-millisecond work. Do not add complexity merely to optimize that bounded loading cost without measured user-visible need.

## Repository workflow

- `main` is accepted stable public state only.
- Runtime work belongs in `dev/X.Y.Z` until explicit player acceptance.
- A numbered DLL is immutable and tied to exact source SHA.
- Candidate artifacts may live in Actions; accepted stable DLLs belong in GitHub Releases and must be the exact tested bytes, not a rebuild under the same version.
- Candidate build workflow is manual-only; documentation-only changes do not justify hosted CI.
- Public README and release notes are user-facing. Keep migration/provenance/private-development details out of them; such evidence belongs in engineering docs.

## Required evidence and records

Use these as long-lived sources of truth:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/VERIFIED_RUNTIME_DATA.md`
- `docs/TEST_BUILD_LOG.md`
- `docs/UNIFIED_INTERACTION_1.1.9.md`
- `docs/EXHAUSTIVE_VALIDATION_HARNESS.md`
- `docs/ADVERSARIAL_NEGATIVE_INTERACTION_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/MIGRATION_PROVENANCE.md`
- current production source and project file

Historical versioned architecture docs remain valid provenance for the versions named in their filenames but are not the current runtime contract.

Before adding a new quest/NPC/gate rule, establish it from repository evidence, targeted runtime evidence, or assembly/serialized-graph inspection. Do not infer internal IDs from display text.

For generic dialogue classification, the accepted structural evidence is **persistent lifecycle consumption on a concrete authored root path**:

- selected answer self-consumption wins;
- otherwise the nearest persistently consumed selectable ancestor owns the interaction;
- the owner must be independently reachable/actionable under current phrase, navigation, and supported SmartRes/AnswerData gates;
- task-owned owners and same-visit descendants are deduplicated;
- reversible, ambiguous, unsupported, utility-like, and root-unreachable structures fail closed.

For compound AnswerData, the accepted structural evidence is the exact verified relay chain and native AND semantics. Unknown relay ownership, ambiguous producers, unexpected intermediate types, unsupported children, or empty child sets fail closed.

Do not broaden either model to arbitrary dialogue visibility, `fh=True` alone, or translated-text heuristics.

For any future structural change to task/dialogue/navigation classification, run the interaction-universe validator before handing a player DLL. An unexplained baseline delta is a failed regression, even if aggregate counts still look plausible. Baseline updates require interaction-level evidence; do not merely change expected numbers to make CI green.

The accepted 2026-09-23 adversarial negative audit closes the known negative frontier for the six weekday NPCs and establishes that historical Watchdog 0.2 `UNKNOWN=0` was not a sufficient semantic oracle. **Do not build or maintain Watchdog 0.3 as a permanent parallel classifier.** If normal play later produces a concrete contradiction (missing marker, extra marker, or unexpected transition), investigate that exact state with the narrowest read-only diagnostic that can resolve it.

The remaining narrow completion/event supplement is not permission to accumulate ad-hoc fixes. Before adding an exact rule, first test whether the state can be represented by the task compiler or dialogue-lifecycle compiler. Exact mappings are allowed only when runtime evidence proves a genuinely different host mechanism.

## Handoff / acceptance

Before handing a candidate DLL to the user:

- clean Release build succeeds;
- artifact is from committed canonical source;
- version metadata is consistent;
- no diagnostic code ships;
- exact source SHA, CI run/artifact ID, file size and SHA-256 are recorded;
- test request is narrow and actually proves the changed behavior.

After explicit player acceptance, freeze the exact tested source, promote the accepted state to `main`, and publish the exact tested DLL through GitHub Releases without rebuilding it.
